A mobile-first PWA that allows users to upload radiologiy image [JPEG,PNG,DICOM zip/rar/folder] images from a phone,tablet or pc directly to a cloud PACS—securely, reliably, and with minimal friction.

Not a full viewer. Not a PACS replacement.
A lightweight DICOM ingestion node.

## Target Users

Telemedicine / remote clinics:Low-infrastructure environments
Clinicians / radiologists: Upload studies captured outside the main PACS workflow

## System Architecture (Simple but Correct)
Framework: React
	PWA features:-Offline queue (critical),	Background sync,Camera + file system access
	Capabilities:Upload DICOM files (.dcm),ZIP folder upload (common for studies),Basic metadata preview (patient name, study ID),clinical impression field,Upload progress
Backend (Upload Node):Acts as a DICOM proxy, not a PACS.
API:- Auth (JWT / OAuth2),Upload endpoint,Status endpoint
Processing:-,Validate DICOM,Chunking & resumable uploads
Forwarding:-Send to cloud PACS via:
	DICOMweb (STOW-RS) preferred
	OR traditional C-STORE via gateway
	
#Security & Compliance (MVP-safe)
Minimum: HTTPS everywhere,Auth required before upload,Short-lived upload tokens,No persistent storage of images on frontend
Optional:Client-side AES encryption

#📱 Mobile-First UX (This Is the Differentiator)
Key UX Decisions:
One primary button: “Upload Study”
Auto-detect:Single DICOM,Multiple DICOMs,ZIP archive,Rar archive,DICOM folder,JPEG,PNG
Show: Patient Name,Study Date,Modality
Allow:Rename / confirm study,Retry failed uploads automatically,clinical data text field
Offline Flow (Huge Win)
	User selects images
	user fills clinical data txt field
	App stores them in IndexedDB
	Upload resumes when network returns
	User gets confirmation
	Most PACS tools do not do this well.
	
# Smart MVP Scope (Don’t Overbuild)
Phase 1 (2–3 weeks)

✅ Upload DICOM files from mobile,tablet or PC
✅ Forward to PACS via DICOMweb
✅ Progress + retry
✅ Auth + basic logging

# Tech Stack Suggestion
Frontend:
	React + Vite
	Workbox (PWA + background sync)
	IndexedDB (Dexie.js)
	Cornerstone.js only for metadata (not viewing)
Backend
	Node.js (Fastify)
	OR Python (FastAPI)
	pydicom
	dicomweb-client
	S3-compatible temp storage
PACS Integration
	DICOMweb STOW-RS
	Orthanc REST API fallbac
	
#Differentiation Ideas (Optional but Powerful)
	QR code that encodes PACS endpoint + token
	“Upload-only” mode (no PHI visible after confirmation)
	Automatic study completeness checks
	Bandwidth-aware chunk sizing
